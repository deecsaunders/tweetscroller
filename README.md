# TweetScroller

**TweetScroller** is a simple jQuery plugin written in CoffeeScript that allows you to pull a collection of your favorite tweets using Twitter API v1.1 and display them in a fancy scroller with Masonry.

We created this for the [Divshot](http://divshot.com) lander and decided to open source it.

## Dependencies

TweetScroller requires the following JavaScript/jQuery dependencies:

* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
* [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/)
* [hoverIntent](http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html)

## Proxy Example

Twitter API v1.1 now requires a server-side proxy. [Click here to view an example in Node.js](https://gist.github.com/fastdivision/7257449).
